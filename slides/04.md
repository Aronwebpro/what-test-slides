# Code Coverage < Use Case Coverage

What does code coverage tell us?

What does code coverage NOT tell us?

## When looking at code...

Don't think about the ifs/elses, loops, or component lifecycles. That's code
coverage...

Instead ask yourself:

> What use cases are these lines of code supporting, and what tests can I add to
> support those use cases?

That's use case coverage.
