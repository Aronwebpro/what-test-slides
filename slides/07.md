# React

Don't think about:

- Lifecycle methods
- Element event handlers
- Internal Component State

Think about your two users (devs and end users):

- User interactions (using `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event`):
  - **What happens** when the end user interacts with the elements that the
    component renders?
- Changing props (using `rerender` from `@testing-library/react`):
  - **What happens** when the developer user re-renders your component with new
    props?
- Context changes (using `rerender` from `@testing-library/react`):
  - **What happens** when the developer user changes context resulting in your
    component re-rendering?
- Subscription changes:
  - **What happens** when an event emitter the component subscribes to changes?
    (Like firebase, a router, a media query, or browser-based subscriptions like
    online status)
